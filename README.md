# ArcadeJS-Requests

I have always loved video games. Since the cartridges for my first Gameboy to my ever-growing Steam library on PC, it's always been a large part of who I am. But play was never quite enough for me. What originally drew me into development was an aspiration to create my own. Ideas come thick and fast, but I have never managed to implemented a single one...

This led to my passion being shelved for a while, due to a lack of requisite knowledge, time and self-belief. But no more!

I'm starting from the beginning, trying to understand the history of game development, while simultaneously developing my knowledge and skillset by creating classic games suggested & voted for by you!

These will hopefully be presented as show-n-tells if there's appetite :)

_The Tool(s) of choice:_ Javascript, HTML5, CSS.
